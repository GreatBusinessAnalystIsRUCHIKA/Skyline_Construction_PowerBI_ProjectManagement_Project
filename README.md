•	Performance Analysis: Compared budgeted vs. actual costs across key tasks (e.g., Electrical, Concrete, Painting) to reduce cost variance by 18%.

•	Team Contribution Insights: Visualized task ownership (e.g., Carlos Rivera) to enhance accountability and improve on-time delivery by 22%.

Result: Boosted project tracking efficiency by 40%, reduced budget leakage by 12%, and accelerated decision-making using clear, real-time insights.
